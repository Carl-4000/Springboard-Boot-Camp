<h1>JSON Mini Project Readme</h1> 

For this exercise, we are tasked to use our new data cleaning skills to 
find three pieces of information that answer the following questions from 
the world bank .json data included in this folder: 

- What are the top 10 countries with the most development projects? 
- What are the top 10 major project themes? 
- how can we clean 'project names' so it doesn't have missing data? 

The full writeup is in the project writeup hosted in this repository.
